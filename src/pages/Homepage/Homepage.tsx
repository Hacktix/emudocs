        <h2>What is Emudocs?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a website aimed at Emulator Developers with the goal of providing unambiguous and accurate, yet understandable documentation of various systems.
            While it does aim to bring quality and accuracy similar to other technical documentations, the main purpose of Emudocs is to add visual and, if applicable,
            interactive explanations of various systems while also combining the specifications for multiple systems on a single site.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is currently heavily Work-in-Progress, so everything you see is subject to change. As of right now there isn't much to see either way, so have
            a cup of tea while you wait: üçµ

        <h2>Who is this site for?</h2>
        <p>
            Emudocs aims to be as understandable as possible for all levels of Emulation Development expertise, however, general knowledge about programming is required.
            For complete beginners in the realm of Emulation, there is a section under development which will try to explain basic emulation concepts which are applicable
            to pretty much all systems. Also, this site does not provide code samples in any specific programming language. If code samples are provided, they're written
            in an "abstract" language which may only rely on features commonly found in most programming languages.
        </p>

        <h2>I found incomplete/inaccurate info!</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/Hacktix/emudocs/issues">Click here and report it!</a> Emudocs is mainly developed by a single person, so it (at least partially)
            relies on user reports to make sure that all information is accurate, complete and easily comprehensible. Also, if you're knowledgeable about a certain system
            which isn't on Emudocs yet and want to help me out, come join my Discord server and get in touch:
