## What's this?
Emudocs is a website aimed at Emulator Developers with the goal of providing unambiguous and accurate, yet understandable documentation of various systems. While it does aim to bring quality and accuracy similar to other technical documentations, the main purpose of Emudocs is to add visual and, if applicable, interactive explanations of various systems while also combining the specifications for multiple systems on a single site.

## What's on here?
Currently the site is heavily WIP, as it's intended to be developed alongside my web-based emulator project [RETROCADE](https://github.com/Hacktix/retrocade). Hence, the list of systems is similar to the one present in that project:

* Space Invaders (Arcade)
* Pac-Man (Arcade)
* Galaga (Arcade)
* Nintendo Entertainment System
* Nintendo Gameboy (Color)
* Sega Master System
* Atari 2600

This list is subject to change and systems may be added or removed at any time.
